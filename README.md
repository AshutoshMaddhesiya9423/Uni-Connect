# 🎭 University Club Portal

A simple React-based portal for university clubs where students can:

- Log in with their name & roll number
- Search clubs by name
- View club details (bulletin, contact, members, views)
- Join a club (restricted to one club per category)
- See other members who have joined

All data is saved in **localStorage**, so your login and joined clubs stay after refresh.
